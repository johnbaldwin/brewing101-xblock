  	<p class="problem-description">Blah, blah, blah. Talk about prerequisite information needed for the next paragraph. Blah, blah, blah...</p>
  	<p class="problem-description">
  	Once the grains have been crushed and put into a mash tun, water is added to begin the mashing process. This water is called the <em>strike water</em>.	How much water, water temperature, how much grain, and grain temperature determine the mash temperature.
  	</p>
  	<div class="equation-section"> 
  		<span class="equation">Strike water temperature Tw = (0.2 / R)(T2-T1) + T2</span>
  		<ul class="calc-variable-list">
  			<li>Tw - Strike water temperature in degrees Fahrenheit </li>
  			<li>R - Ratio of water to grain in quarts per pound</li>
  			<li>T1 - Initial temperature of the mash (grain before adding water)</li>
  			<li>T2 - Target temperature of the mash (grain after water is added)</li>
  		</ul>
  	</div>
	<p class="problem-description"> If we have 10 quarts of water and 10 pounds of grain (for a ratio value of 1) and the grain is room temperature (70 &deg;F), what temperature do we need for the strike water to get a target temperature of 155&deg;F? Round your answer up to the next whole number.
